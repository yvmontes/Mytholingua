<h1>Mytholingua</h1>
This project is a fictional language translator application. This project solved the problem of taking user inputted text and returning the correct translation for each fictional language. To solve this problem the Fun Translations API was used along with JavaScript to return the translated text in the translation box. Currently this application translates the following languages:<br/><br/>

1. Valyrian<br/>
2. Dothraki<br/>
3. Elvish<br/>
4. Minion
